        <h2>Our Mission</h2>
        <p>
            Woodinville Connect was created to provide residents with a centralized, easy-to-use
            platform that highlights local resources, support services, and community events.
            Our goal is to make it simple for individuals and families to find the help and
            opportunities they need.
        </p>

        <h2>Why This Matters</h2>
        <p>
            Communities thrive when people know where to turn for assistance. From food
            security and healthcare to youth programs and volunteer opportunities, access to
            reliable information strengthens neighborhoods and empowers residents.
        </p>

        <h2>Community Impact</h2>
        <p>
            By organizing local services into one searchable hub, Woodinville Connect helps
            reduce barriers to access and increases awareness of valuable programs. We aim to
            support residents, promote civic engagement, and encourage collaboration among
            community organizations.
        </p>

        <h2>Created For</h2>
        <p>
            This website was developed as part of the TSA Webmaster Competition to serve the
            Woodinville community and demonstrate the power of accessible digital tools in
            strengthening local connections.
